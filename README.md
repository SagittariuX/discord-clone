## Discord Clone

Work In Progress Aiming to have a basic demo by end of Apr \

My attempt at designing and creating a discord clone.
\
This program allows users to log in with his/her Google account and chat with other people.
\
The user is allowed to create servers and channels just like Discord.
Each channel has one dedicated chat room.
\
The user can invite others (via email reference) into servers and begin chating with each other.
\
Users can also search for other users (via email reference) and add them as friends.
\
## Currently
\
Have implemented real time chat, and user-server-channel relationships.
\

## Need to implement
\
Adding friends and server invite system
\
